            <h3>About my classes and offers...</h3>
            <p>I am a yoga instructor and massage therapist with a passion to
                travel around the world and to work with people through my skills
                and understanding of their needs. Influenced by my teachers,
                peers, environment and my travels I aim to bring unique sense of
                empowerment to each of my class. Through intention, meditation,
                pranayama and asana my goal is to have my students leave each
                class feeling refreshed and renewed.
                I also add some massage elements into my yoga classes to increase
                the best feelings for all my students. All my classes are delivered in
                English and Polish language and I put maximum hands to assist during the
                sessions.
