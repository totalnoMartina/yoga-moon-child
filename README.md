# Design

## Colour scheme

The colour scheme for the website was chosen in agreement with Dominka. Her logo was in dark colours and with blue representing night and deep water, while her photos are pink and purple which helped decide on the shades. Good use of website called [Coolors](https://coolors.co/97ead2-8cc7a1-816e94-74226c-4b2142) when choosing colours. The image of the color palette is below.

# Credits

In making of the webpage, Dominika, the Yoga teacher, provided all of the informations in text and all images. Logo was designed by her, too. As she already is teaching yoga and having her social account that represents her yoga teachings, she had many photos. Text was taken from CV and cover letters. She helped a lot in creating the booking form page. Image of [Dali Dhamma](https://bookretreats.com/teacher/dali-dhamma) was taken from his website.

While exploring options that make a good website I thought the idea of a button that brings you back to top of page when you scroll far down is a great one, I found out how to go about that on the [link here](https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/10886-how-can-i-add-a-scroll-to-top-button/).
Barbara Radovic, from Croatia, helped with word-proofing the text.

Gallery is made with an inline-flex property which I was inspired by this [link](https://www.developerdrive.com/responsive-image-gallery-flexbox/)

# Content

The entire content was provided by Dominka, this amazing yoga teacher, she had cover letters and CV samples written, and many images were taken by her friends all around the world.
The form was helped to be created by Dominika in text, offers, prices and structure.

# Media

All images are provided by Dominka Urbanska and I was given permission to use it on this site. There is an image of Dali Dhamma, yoga teacher which was taken from his [website](https://bookretreats.com/teacher/dali-dhamma).
